       <p>Hello! My name is Manolo Lagahit and I am a student at Year Up studying Software Development and Testing.</p>
       
       <p>Before Year Up I was a nursing student and working as a Nursing Assistant and I hope that I can apply the knowledge I gained from Nursing to working in a buisness setting.</p>
       
       <p>I've gained many skills at Year Up such as programming languages like, JavaScript, Java, and Python. I learned how to use many Microsoft apps like, Excel, SharePoint, Power Apps, and Teams.</p>
       
       <p>However, I didn't only learn technical skills, but I also learned many soft skills like, effective communication, public speaking, and teamwork. These are skills that I gained comfort with from nursing, but Year Up has helped me strengthen them more.</p>
           
      <p>I hope that all the new knowledge I've gained at Year Up and the skills that I already have from Nursing will help me become a strong member in the corporate world, as a person who not only has the technical skill to succeed, but to also be a compassionate team member.</p>
